# Welcome to Artificialis Open Source!

Let's get it started!

### One rule
We don't care if you break stuff. Use this place as a playground. Learn how to work and collaborate with teams and friends.

## How to join
As you probably know, you can find us on the [Artificialis Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RJnGnAWvjM), where you can meet Visionary.

Head over to the #bot channel of Artificialis, and type `.github-add <github-username>`. This will automatically send you an invitation to join this organization.

You're basically done! You can now collaborate to existing projects, or start your own. Make sure to let the Management Team know what you're working on!
