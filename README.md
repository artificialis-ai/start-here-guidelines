# Welcome to Artificialis Open Source!

Let's get it started!

### One rule
We don't care if you break stuff. Use this place as a playground. Learn how to work and collaborate with teams and friends.

## How to join
As you probably know, you can find us on the [Artificialis Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RJnGnAWvjM), where you can meet Visionary.

Head over to the #bot channel of Artificialis, and type `.github-add <github-username>`. This will automatically send you an invitation to join this organization.

You're basically done! You can now collaborate to existing projects, or start your own. Make sure to let the Management Team know what you're working on!

## Get started
1. Checkout a [short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) on Git and Github by freeCodeCamp
2. Head over to our existing projects or create a new repository with your friends. On the github page of the repository, click on "Fork".

3. Now go to your Github profile, and head over to the repository you just forked. Open your terminal and git clone it.

`git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/your-forked-repo.git`

4. Enter your project's directory. Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts: if they happen, you'll have to resolve, there are multiple guides online.
5. After adding the upstream and checking that all files are up to date, before adding any changes, we'll create a new branch for you to work on:
`git checkout -b <branch-name>`
6. Do your stuff, then git add and git commit accordingly (always write a good commit message):
```
git add <your files>
git commit -m "commit message"
```

7. Next, push your changes to _your_ repository:
`git push origin master`

8. Finally, create a pull request:

Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

9. Go on, join a project, start a new one. Don't be shy!
